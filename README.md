# Soft and Biohybrid Robotics Notes

This repository contains my notes and project data from Soft and Biohybrid Robotics, taken at ETH ZÃ¼rich with Prof. Robert Katzschmann taken the Spring of 2023. It is mostly for personal reference, however, if you find this useful then feel free to use this repository.

## Contents
The following things are contained:
- A full class summary. This will likely have some typos, but it is a decent representation of different soft and biohybrid robotics technologies and can be referred to as such.
- First two projects which are little art projects to describe our understanding of core technologies in soft and biohybrid robotics. Take these lightly, I am an engineer not an artist...
- Third project which consists of using [SOFA](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/sofa) to model and control soft robotics parts.
